# Attribution_Modeling_Thesis
This repo contains all the code files for my Master's Thesis in NUIG titled "Exploring Attribution Modeling in Digital Advertising".
<br />The code_notebooks folder contains all the code files wherein I performed data exploration and derived attribution allocation, prediction performance, and explainability results for various attribution models.
<br />The saved_models contain all trained and saved LSTM models used in this project.
<br />The data used for this project can be accessed via this link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/jrw7atq517jxzqrn2gxz5/ALfzBkRA90d2z7UmLcLqQRs?rlkey=6qg8wfcdrwuy9kfya6kejcq11&e=1&st=fh1lanzk&dl=0
