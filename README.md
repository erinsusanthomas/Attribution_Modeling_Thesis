# Attribution_Modeling_Thesis
This repository contains all the code files for my Master's Thesis at NUIG, titled "Exploring Attribution Modeling in Digital Advertising."
## Contents
[Code Notebooks](code_notebooks/): This directory includes the following notebooks wherein I performed data exploration and derived attribution allocation, prediction performance, and explainability results for various attribution models:
This directory contains various notebooks where I conducted data analysis, model development, and evaluation
- [Data Preprocessing](code_notebooks/0-Data%20Exploration.ipynb): This notebook covers the dataset summary, pre-processing steps and data exploration.
- [Traditional Attribution Models](code_notebooks/1-Traditional%20Models.ipynb): This notebook includes the code for attribution allocation using traditional attribution models.
- [Logistic Regression Model](code_notebooks/2-Logistic%20Regression.ipynb.ipynb): This notebook includes the code for attribution allocation, prediction performance, and explainability results using a Logistic Regression model.
- [Random Forest Model](code_notebooks/3-Random%20Forest.ipynb.ipynb): This notebook includes the code for attribution allocation, prediction performance, and explainability results using a Random Forest model.
<br />The code_notebooks folder contains all the code files wherein I performed data exploration and derived attribution allocation, prediction performance, and explainability results for various attribution models.
<br />The saved_models contain all trained and saved LSTM models used in this project.
<br />The data used for this project can be accessed via this link: [dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/jrw7atq517jxzqrn2gxz5/ALfzBkRA90d2z7UmLcLqQRs?rlkey=6qg8wfcdrwuy9kfya6kejcq11&e=1&st=fh1lanzk&dl=0)
